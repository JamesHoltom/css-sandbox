# CSS Sandbox

Sandbox for playing around with CSS3 features, primarily flexbox and 3D transformations.

Currently includes:

* A 3D cube that can be moved/rotated, with a toggleable animation.
* A "world" editor, allowing users to make primitive maps. Includes a save/load feature.

Further developments could include:

*World*:

* Setting textures for face elements.
* Add "sprites" which ignore 3D transformations (i.e. setting the *transform-style* to `flat`). Could also include setting *scale* and *skew*.
* Allow for moving the camera in *Edit* mode.
* Spin off into a separate project, with physics and collisions(?).

*Parallax*:

* Set up a container for experimenting with parallax scrolling.
